		<p class="lead">As malicious events happen so fast, any prevention solution requires an immediate propagation.</p>

			<strong>SocialGuard has no propagation delay.</strong><br />
			As our API centralises all records, all entries from our emitters are effective immediately.

		<p>
			As we operate with transparency, <strong>all SocialGuard records are public</strong>, and <a href="/swagger" target="_blank">accessible with our API</a>.
			This allows any developer to integrate SocialGuard's records into their bots and servers.
			Moreover, our entire project is Open-Source, and its development is community-driven.
