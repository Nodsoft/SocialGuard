			SocialGuard has no propagation delay. 
			As our API centralises all results, all entries by our emitters are effective immediately.

		<p class="lead">SocialGuard is open to use by anyone, and with public records.</p>

		<p>
			As we operate with transparency, all our records are public, and <a href="/swagger">accessible with our API</a>.
			This allows any developer to integrate SocialGuard's records into their project, and servers.
			Moreover, our entire project is Open-Source, and its development is community-driven.
